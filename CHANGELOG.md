## [2025.03.02]

### Added

- [src/lib/standard.alf](src/lib/standard.alf)
    - New `Wall` and `Ramp` macros support bounding-box definitions as well as the old center-dimensions definitions. Use whichever you prefer or whatever the situation calls for. The parameters are flexible. Mix and match as you please.
    - The `Ramp` macro creates seamless ramps, regardless of thickness. No more visible gaps! (Gaps are still an option, of course. We love gaps too.)
    - The `Ramp` macro allows ramps of arbitrary size. Goodbye 20x20 restriction, hello gigantic ramps.
